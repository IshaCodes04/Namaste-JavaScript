                              *Namaste Javascript*

*"Everything in javascript happens inside an execution context"*

- we can assume it looks like a big box in which whole javascript code is executed.

- A big box which has 2 components in it :- 

1. Memory Component 

- where all variables and functions can be stored as the form of key : value pairs for ex - a : 10 , fnc : {...} 

- Memory component know as variable environment.

2. Code Component

- This is the place where code is executed one line at a time.

- code component also know as Thread of Execution.


*"JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language"*

- Single threaded means javascript can execute only one command at a time.
